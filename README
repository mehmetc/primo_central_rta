SUMMARY:
Real Time Availability for Primo Central records is not always correctly labeled. We created an acceptable workaround for us to go live with Primo Central 
and hope that Ex Libris is working hard to fix this.

We rely on 'Define link from title' -> 'Link to online resource' setting in the Views Wizard -> Brief Results screen. This setting will create SFX links 
for every online available record. We extract the ISSN/EISSN, DATE and RECORD ID from the SFX links and query SFX RSI for full text availability and update
the screen accordingly.

REMARKS:
	- Only updates PrimoCentral records
	- updates records with issn/eissn 
	- no 'Online resource' tab for updated records you must click the SFX tab
	- Updated records are not part of the 'FullText online Available' top facet
	- sometimes fails to run in Chrome

INSTALL:
The solution is based on jQuery on the client side and a Ruby/Rack based solution on the server side.

	CLIENT:
		FILES:
			rta_test.html					used for testing RTA 
			jquery.limo.js					RTA client code
		USAGE:
			include jquery.limo.js in Primo.
			
			<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.limo.js"></script>
			
			Supply the location of the RTA service and call update with the SFX institution you want to query.
			
			<script type="text/javascript">
				$(document).ready(function(){
					jQuery.limo.primo_central.rta.url='http://my.rta.service.com/';
					jQuery.limo.primo_central.rta.update('KULeuven');
				});
			</script>
			
	SERVER:
		FILES:
			config.ru						Rack wrapper
			lib/primo_central_rta.rb		rsi query logic
		USAGE:
			The server is Ruby based and depends on Rack, Nokogiri, JSON. 
			You should update the RSI_URL and DEFAULT_SFX_INSTITUTION in lib/primo_central_rta.rb 
			Starting the service for testing
				rackup -p 3000 config.ru

Once the service is running you can test it with rta_test.html or Primo
